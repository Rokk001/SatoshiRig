## [2.14.0] - 2024-12-XX

### Added
- **Persistent Statistics**: Statistics are now automatically saved to disk and persist across Docker container restarts
  - Statistics file location: `/app/data/statistics.json` (configurable via `STATS_FILE` environment variable)
  - Auto-saves every 10 status updates and on shutdown
  - Preserves: total_hashes, peak_hash_rate, shares_submitted, shares_accepted, shares_rejected
- **Improved CPU/GPU Mining Control**: 
  - CPU mining toggle now automatically manages backend selection
  - GPU backend dropdown only shows CUDA/OpenCL (CPU is controlled via toggle)
  - Both CPU and GPU mining can be enabled simultaneously
  - Backend selection is intelligently managed based on toggle states

### Changed
- **Compute Configuration UI**: 
  - Backend dropdown renamed to "GPU Backend" and only shows CUDA/OpenCL options
  - CPU mining is now exclusively controlled via the CPU Mining toggle
  - Improved tooltips and labels for better user understanding
- **Statistics Persistence**: Statistics are now loaded from persistent storage on startup and merged with new session data

### Fixed
- **Wallet Address Saving**: Wallet address is now properly saved when using the "Save Configuration" button
- **Backend Logic**: Fixed redundant CPU option in backend dropdown - CPU is now only controlled via toggle

### Technical Details
- Added `stats_persistence.py` module for handling persistent statistics storage
- Implemented thread-safe file operations with atomic writes
- Added shutdown handlers to ensure statistics are saved on container stop
- Updated Docker Compose configuration to include persistent data volume

## [2.13.0] - Previous Release

### Features
- GPU support with CUDA and OpenCL backends
- Web dashboard with real-time monitoring
- Docker support with NVIDIA Container Toolkit
- Configuration via TOML files and environment variables
