# Project Status

Updated: 2025-01-27

## Latest Changes (v2.25.22)
- **CPU Mining Reliability**: Batched CPU hashing now retains the best candidate hash each batch, ensuring `hash_hex`/`nonce_hex` are always defined so the loop never stalls at the guard check.

## Previous Changes (v2.25.19)
- **Mining Loop Debugging Improvements**: Added critical initialization and INFO-level logging to diagnose mining loop issues
  - Initialize `merkle_root = None` at the start of each loop iteration to prevent NameError
  - Added INFO-level logs immediately after "Mining iteration 0" to track loop progress
  - Added INFO-level logs before GPU/CPU mining checks to identify where loop hangs
  - Logs now show whether `merkle_root` is defined at critical points
  - Helps diagnose why mining loop stops after "Mining iteration 0"
  - Ensures loop can progress even if merkle_root calculation fails

## Previous Changes (v2.25.18)
- **Fixed Verbose Logging Implementation**: Corrected `_vlog()` function to properly check DEBUG logging level
  - `_vlog()` now checks both `verbose` flag AND `logger.isEnabledFor(logging.DEBUG)`
  - Logs will now appear when DEBUG level is enabled, regardless of `verbose` config flag
  - Updated `Miner.__init__` to set `_verbose_logging` based on both config flag and DEBUG level
  - Fixes issue where verbose logs were not appearing even when DEBUG logging was enabled

  - Ensures continuous loop progression even when encountering invalid data from pool

## Previous Changes (v2.25.11)
- **Critical Fix: Mining Loop Progress**: Fixed two cases where `hash_count` was not incremented before `continue`
  - When `hash_hex` contains invalid hex format (ValueError), `hash_count` is now incremented before continuing
  - When `this_hash_int == 0` (zero hash), `hash_count` is now incremented before continuing
  - Prevents mining loop from getting stuck when encountering invalid hash values
  - Ensures continuous loop progression and accurate hash rate calculation

## Previous Changes (v2.25.10)
- **Critical Fix: Mining Loop Stuck at Iteration 0**: Fixed issue where mining loop would get stuck at iteration 0
  - `hash_count` was only incremented when CPU mining succeeded
  - If `block_header` build failed or `binascii.unhexlify()` failed, `hash_count` was not incremented

  - Hash rate is now calculated in every iteration, regardless of whether hash was produced
  - Dashboard now correctly displays hash rate even when mining loop is running but no successful hashes yet
  - Prevents hash rate from showing 0 H/s when mining is actually active

## Previous Changes (v2.25.8)
- **Critical Fix: CPU Mining Hash Not Assigned**: Fixed issue where `hash_hex` and `nonce_hex` were not set from CPU mining results
  - Code that assigns `hash_hex = cpu_hash_hex` was incorrectly placed inside `else:` block (only executed when CPU mining disabled)
  - Moved hash assignment code outside of `if cpu_mining_enabled:` block so it always executes
  - Prevents "hash_hex or nonce_hex not defined" error when CPU mining is enabled
  - CPU mining now correctly sets `hash_hex` and `nonce_hex` for target comparison and share submission

## Previous Changes (v2.25.7)
